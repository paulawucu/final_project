### Motivation:
“Drug Overdose Deaths Remain High” - the headline posted by CDC rings the bell. Ever since 1999, nearly 841,000 people have died from drug overdoses. 70,630 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States, in 2019 alone [1,2]. The abuse of and addiction to drugs is a genuine national crisis that influences public health as well as social and financial welfare. <br><br>
Deaths resulting from drug overdose increases drastically in every state of the U.S. especially in states with the legality of cannabis or marijuana in recent years. Drug overdose is becoming an increasingly significant social and public health problem in the United States. <br><br>
Though CDC has posted the US drug overdose death rate and rate change maps from 2014-2019 along with the rate change graphs from 2014-2017, there hasn’t been any update for the past two years. Thus, our group wants to start from here and do more investigation upon the drug overdose death rate across states in the US. Fortunately, there are available drug-overdose-related data online to propel our motivation even further. 

### Intended Final Product
The final product will be an organized report, a web page, a screencast, and corresponding Github repo. The report will fully describe our process and results and cover data collection and cleaning, exploratory analyses, alternative strategies, descriptions of approaches, and a discussion of results. We will also create a webpage and a screencast for our project that can give an overview of the project scope, data, approaches, visualizations, and other results.<br><br>
Our final products could help to identify the factors that are associated with drug overdose and drug overdose death. Based on identified factors, we could draw a picture for the groups of people that are more vulnerable when facing drug overdose. <br><br>
We will include heat maps to indicate rates or changes over the past few years. 

### Anticipated Data Source
Based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System, this data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths within the 50 and the District of Columbia 2015-2021 (https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/VSRR-Provisional-Drug-Overdose-Death-Counts/xkb8-kh2a)

### Planned Analyses
How different types of drugs affect the death rate? Drug usage in different states? What identities make people more likely to be trapped into drug overdose in the U.S? <br>
We will probably use time-series analysis and wants to find the most significant factors that contribute to a higher drug overdose rate / death rate over times. 

### Visualizations 
Created a map that allows users to view the fatality rate of overdose in various states of the US.
Mortality (rate) caused by each type of drug
Types of drug overdose by region 
Fatality rate in different years with different types of drug
Cause of death across different drug
 
### Coding challenges
Multi-dimensional data processing
Data tidying
Data mining
Combination of different datasets
